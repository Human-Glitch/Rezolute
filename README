# Rezolute
2D platforming game capstone project

Kody Buss' Capstone Project for Spring 2017. This project was developed in Unity Game Engine using C# language. 
Features a prologue, main menu, level 1, level 2, and a rolling credits. 
The concept is that you are a piece of data that overflowed from an array into the Heap. 
You have to traverse your way through a computer's memory all the while survive the Garbage Collector's attempts to clean you up.

==============================================================================
Accomplishments for this project:
==============================================================================
Design
==============
-Design that is accessible, fun, and challenging
-Designed in a way that allows for game state resets without reloading!
-Dynamic gameplay that can shift and change unexpectedly!
-Minimal UI to keep player immersed in the gameplay
-Unique art design and aesthetic
-Music dynamically changes on context using a unique sound managment system

Milestones
==============
-Playable from start to finish without major glitches
-Extensively playtested for fair and balanced design
-20 minutes - 1hour of gameplay
-No loading times
-Achieved professional quality
-Gameplay is seamless and delightfully surprising
-This project has over 300 hours of development time over just one semester of school. 
-Completion of multi-discipline project including: design, programming, art, sound design, filmmaking, and animation. 

Coding
==============
-Animation of 4 major types of game characters
-30 modularized scripts and over 3000 lines of code
-Reverse programming to undo effects of executed scripts on game state failures
-Dynamic scripts that smartly produces different behaviors depending on contexts
-Inheritance of scripts to work in multiple contexts
-Fully encapsulated design allow for modularized and flexible scripts depending on data fed to them
-Major algorithm breakthroughs to create repeatably executed scripts that provide accurate results over time

Time Management
===============
-Fully executed vision for project by sticking to a firm deadlines
-Cut ideas that weren't practical and redesigned them for reimplementation
-Balanced design, implementation of ideas, and design in reoccuring phases throughout development
-Developed in three major phases: Core mechanics and obstacles, Level 1 Design and Cube Trap, Level 2 Design and Scanner/Boss Mechanics
