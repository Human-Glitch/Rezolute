Kody Buss' Capstone Project for Spring 2017. This project was developed in Unity Game Engine using C# language. 
Features a prologue, main menu, level 1, level 2, and a rolling credits. 
The concept is that you are a piece of data that overflowed from an array into the Heap. 
You have to traverse your way through a computer's memory all the while survive the Garbage Collector's attempts to clean you up.
